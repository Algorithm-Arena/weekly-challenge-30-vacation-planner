# Weekly Challenge #30 - Vacation Planner

**For this challenge, you need to implement a program that takes a number of vacation days and outputs a suggested calendar for how to take those vacations.** I skipped last week's challenge as I was in vacation and it reminded me that a lot of people don't take their vacations because they don't plan for them. So this week's challenge is a small tool to help people plan their vacations so that they actually take them :)
